During my B.Sc. I have taught students in my locality as social service directed by Ramakrishna Mission. Till date I teach them whenever I get time.

Before joining M.Sc. I worked as a FOSSEE summer fellow for 2 months under IIT Bombay and woked on creating illustrative [notes](https://math.animations.fossee.in/contents/calculus-of-several-variables) to aid students on Integrals of Multivariable Functions.
